                He was the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents 
                until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan.
                This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of 
                them off the face of the Earth. </p>

                 and lived with him and his parents, Grisha and Carla, before the fall of Wall Maria. She is the last descendant of 
                 the Shogun clan that stayed on Paradis Island, thereby related to the Azumabito family, and holds significant political power in Hizuru.

                 deuteragonists of the series. Although he appears to be among the physically weakest of the 104th Training Corps, his intelligence
                  and strategic genius makes him an invaluable asset, especially when paired with Hange. After the battle of Shiganshina District, 
                  he took the power of the Titans from Bertolt Hoover and came in possession of the Colossus Titan.
